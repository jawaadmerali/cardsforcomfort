Card For Comfort is a website created by me, Jawaad Merali, dedicated to brightening the lives of elderly residents in nursing homes. Through personalized cards, we aim to bring joy, warmth, and a sense of connection to seniors who may feel isolated. My mission is to remind them that they are loved, valued, and remembered, one card at a time.
